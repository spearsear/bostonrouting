A multiple day route planner? This is much needed for example by landscapers who want to generate a multiple day plan of their mowing routes.

The difficulty is however at the administrative work of updating the work being done each day. Especially when the truck missed some stops due to various reason, for example delay of work time. The routing plan for the rest of the days needs to be reoptimized. However this requires the landscaper to have a reliable system to do dataentry in order to reflect the current work done, before the reoptimization should start.

Currently we expect the landscaper coming back to bostonrouting.com to update the new customers list, and reoptimize.
