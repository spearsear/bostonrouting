If you do mulching, fertilization, aeration and many other landscaping jobs, or if your small business do driveway sealing, roofing, or christmas decoration, often times you need to measure the size of the lawn, the area of the driveway, length of the house, area of the roof, etc.

You can go the site to do measuring physically but hey, we are no longer in the 80s, you need to take advantage of the new technology to do online measuring. You will find it so easy and enjoy doing it, and you do not even need to leave your office. Save that gas money to buy yourself a cup of coffee!

There are many online measuring sites which you need to pay monthly fee to use, but you are a small business, you need to take care too many payments, not another one. You want to use a free service and mostly it is enough for your needs.

We have created the free online measuring tool - [`iMeasure`](http://bostonrouting.com/imeasure), to help you do online measurement, mostly you will not need to pay for using `iMeasure`, since our free tier of service is very generous to allow you using it without cost - up to 200 measurementlines will be offered to you for free. So rest assured this is a service you could use for the long run.

With `iMeasure`, you can:

* Measure multiple areas by color code
* Measure multiple line segments by color code
* `iMeasure` will automatically sum up the area and the length of line segments by color code
* `iMeasure` will automatically sum up the total area and the length of lines of all color code
* `iMeasure` allows you to write some comments about each measurement area or line segments so you know what they
* `iMeasure` allows you to save the measurement and give you a link back, you can copy the saved link and get back to the measurement later
* `iMeasure` allows you to email the measurement to either your client or yourself

Many landscapers like Dave's Landscape out of Hudson Ma already use this tool daily to measure their job size and quote their customers.
