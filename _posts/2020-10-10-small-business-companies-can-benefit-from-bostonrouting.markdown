Small business owners usually does not have the need nor budget to subscribe to a routing service from a dedicated `routing software`. Instead, their routing needs are more sporadic and sometimes daily, yet they need many rounds of trial to finally settle on a route they like. `bostonrouting.com` offers such service to the small business owners, they do not need to worry about budgets and monthly subscription, they can just use `bostonrouting.com` whenever they need to, like one of our landscaping client says, "we use `bostongrouting.com` to optimize our mowing routes about once every few days, when we have new customers or when we have missed mowing schedule due to holiday or bad weather".

[`bostonrouting.com`](http://bostonrouting.com) helps following small business to optimize their routes:

* Landscaping companies
* Snow removal companies
* Food deliering companies
* Home service companies
* Trash removal companies
* etc

We also work directly with small business companie to customize routing solutions for them.

Routing is complex matter, especially when you have many special constraints, you will quickly give up and just do things randomly, this is when you lose your competitive edge to your rival companies. Stop losing the game and contact bostonrouting.com for help, we are a bunch of nerds and hackers who can code advanced algorithms which can execute fast:

{% highlight ruby %}
def optimalRouteFor(company_name)
  getRoutingProblemFor(company_name)
    .solve
    .getRoute
end
print(optimalRouteFor('Jack's Pole'))
#=> print optimal route to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
